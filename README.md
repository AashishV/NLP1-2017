## Required software

### Easy installation

The easiest way to get the required software is to install Anaconda. See https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

We highly advice this: it contains all required packages, including python and jupyter. We also recommend installing python 3.6.

### Manually install packages

You can also install the packages separately. We will need:

* python >= 3.5.2  (installation depends on your OS)
* numpy
* jupyter notebook https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
* matplotlib -- use `pip install matplotlib` or `pip3 install matplotlib`
