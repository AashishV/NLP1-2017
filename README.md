# Natural Language Processing 1 (2017-2018)

This repository holds all of the labs for the course [NLP1](http://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2017-2018/zoek-vak/vak/37834) offered at the University of Amsterdam as part of the [MSc Artificial Intelligence](http://gss.uva.nl/content/masters/artificial-intelligence/study-programme/study-programme.html) and the [MSc Logic](https://www.illc.uva.nl/MScLogic/) programs.

Additional course-related notebook-tutorials will also be found here.

## Labs

Find the labs in the folder. The data for the labs is on **Blackboard** in the folder **course-materials**. You will be notified each time a new labs becomes available.

* Lab 1. Getting acquainted with language data and language models

## Pytorch tutorial

Most of your projects will involve [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), so we will have a PyTorch tutorial in the *Laptopcollege*. This tutorial will focus on introducing you to the key functionality of this library: `Tensor`, `Variable`, `Autograd`, and the `nn module`.

#### More
The tutorials section of the PyTorch website is an excellent source. If you are interested in learning more about PyTorch, we especially recommend the following:
* [Pytorch with Examples](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html) for a general outlook on PyTorch
* [Deep Learning NLP](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_nlp_tutorial.html) for some NLP related implementations
* [Character RNN Classification](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html) and [Generating Names with a Character-Level RNN](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial.html) for a simple RNN implementation

## Required software

### Easy installation

The easiest way to get the required software is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). We highly advice this: it contains all required packages, including Python. We also recommend installing python 3.6.

### Manually install packages

You can also install the packages separately. We will need:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) version >= 3.5.2  (installation depends on your OS)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

(You can see why we advice the Anaconda distribution...)
