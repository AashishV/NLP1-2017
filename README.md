# Natural Language Processing 1 (2017-2018)

This repository holds all of the labs for NLP1. The data for these are on Blackboard in the folder `course-materials/lab-x`.

## Labs

Find the labs in the folder [labs](labs). You will be notified when they become available.

1. Getting acquainted with language data and language models

## Pytorch tutorial

Most of your projects will involve [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/). We will have a tutorial on it where we introduce the key functionality of this library: `Tensor`, `Variable`, `Autograd`, and the `nn module`.

## Required software

### Easy installation

The easiest way to get the required software is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). We highly advice this: it contains all required packages, including Python. We also recommend installing python 3.6.

### Manually install packages

You can also install the packages separately. We will need:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) version >= 3.5.2  (installation depends on your OS)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

(You can see why we advice the Anaconda distribution...)
